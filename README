This is your new Play 2.0 application
=====================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `play dist`.

What is DbColorer?
==================

DbColorer allows you to categorize something like database columns
with colors. The project is also my first Scala Play 2 project, so
there will be some mistakes in the project structure early on.

How to run?
===========

DbColorer is very much in progress .. so this is not polished.

1. Get Play 2.0.1 (or newer, I hope)
2. Clone the repo
3. Go to the project directory
4. "play"
5. "~run"
6. In a browser go to "http://localhost:9000/createTestData". 
   This will create the H2 database with some data.
7. Go to "http://localhost:9000/".

I use Eclipse with Scala IDE for editing and some of the Eclipse files are 
in the repo.
